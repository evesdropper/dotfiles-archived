# LuaSnip Snippets
A collection of snippets, mainly used for typesetting LaTeX. I don't really use (Neo)vim for code editing, but I should. Here's some documentation for my snippets as I move snippets from UltiSnips to LuaSnip.

## Why LuaSnip?
- Faster - LuaSnip is a bit faster than UltiSnips
- Just so I can have a (mostly) Lua configuration.

## Snippet Philosophy
- Easy to activate - triggers should be either easy to type or something that makes sense (e.g. a lot of semantic snippets are similar to Markdown symbols)
- Modular - snippets should not be too rigid (e.g. a snippet should be able to be used in multiple use cases)
